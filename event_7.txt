Q2@@@I'm very confused as to what Q2 is asking for. Can someone answer the following questions?  1) An image is a collection of pixels, where each pixel is one of RGB, and also has an x-coordinate and y-coordinate value (I'm sure those aren't the right terminologies but). Am I correct? 2) The feature here is the colour channels, according to the assignment. Does that mean all examples have only one feature we're examining, and that is the colour? 3) What is the 'output' or the 'result'? (I.e., in the context of our lectures, the y vector?) Is it an X-Y coordinate? I.e., y = [ (1,1) (10,34) (56,42) ... ]^T  I guess I'm very confused because I'm used to the notation we're familiar with, which is X and y, where each row in X is an example and each column in X is a feature, and each row entry in y is the 'result' corresponding to the row example in X.@@@1) We flatten the image so that the number of examples $$n$$ is the total number of pixels. 2) The number of features $$d$$ is 3, the number of colour channels. 3) This is an unsupervised (clustering) problem, so there is no $$y$$. You'll construct $$X$$ which will be of size (number of pixels) x 3. When you're done, each of your $$k$$ means will be a vector of length 3. In other words each of your means will be a colour. These will be your prototype colours -- the small number of colours that you've found to be the most useful. Then you'll reconstruct the images using only these $$k$$ colours instead of all possible colours.@@@2017-05-29T20:44:44Z@@@hw2 student

A2: Q1.3@@@Are we suppose to get algorithm that classifies each outlier to the closest cluster (assuming each cluster in the center is classified correctly)? It seems like I get the same results for k-means and k-medians, which should not be corrected; according to the question the results should be different Edit: Accidentally used L1 for k-means error, using L2 indeed leads to not so great clustering, which actually raised another question for me. What's the reason to use L2 instead of L1 for k-means if L1 works better in the case with outliers?@@@When you say "use L2 instead of L1" do you mean as the error function which is then used to pick the best of 50 runs? The reason, then, is that the $$k$$-means clustering algorithm itself corresponds to minimizing the L2 loss (as described in Q1.1). So with L2 we're just continuing to use the loss we were already using implicitly. Doing what you suggested is a bit "inconsistent".Is that helpful?@@@2017-05-29T00:17:58Z@@@hw2 student

Collinearity@@@I understand that the solution is not unique if we have collinearity. But what do we mean when say "and yet, there are no local minima because of convexity" What's the point of that sentence? Thanks!@@@Consider these two functions: First function, $$f(x)=x^4-x^2-0.1x$$ Second function, $$f(x)=max(0,x^2-1)$$ If the solution to $$\nabla f(x)=0$$ is not unique, the worry is that you might be in situation 1. And that you've found the minimum on the left instead of the one on the right (which is better). But convexity means you're in situation 2: multiple places with$$\nabla f(x)=0$$ but all have the same function value (namely, the lowest possible). So all are considered equally good and you don't have to worry about which one you have (or at least the little optimizer inside your head doesn't worry; the little machine learner worries, hence tomorrow's lecture).@@@2017-05-30T05:39:19Z@@@other student

A2 Q1.1@@@I'm having some trouble understanding the objective formula that's in the question. After printing out the means matrixthere are k rows which corresponds to the k clusterings. However, I am confused how thisrelates to $$w_{{c_i}j}$$. Also, are we supposed to be using the utils.euclidean_dist_squared function or are we implementing the summations ourselves.@@@$$w_{c_{i}}$$ is the cluster that corresponds to the cluster that $$x_i$$ belongs to. This is after you fit k means to the training data to obtain the cluster label for each training datum. the $$j$$ is the feature. So for each datum, you compute a squared distance to the corresponding dimension of the cluster. So if $$x_i$$ is [1,2,3,4,5] and its closest cluster mean is $$w_{c_{i}}$$, which is [1,1,1,1,1], then the distance is $$(1-1)^2 + (2 - 1)^2 + (3-1)^2 \dots$$ Yes you can use utils.euclidean_dist_squared@@@2017-05-29T00:46:23Z@@@hw2 student

How can I re-write it in a clean matrix/vector form? Also, just want to double check -- is the question supposed to be $$f(w) {=} \sum_{i=1}^n  \log\left(\exp(w^Tx_i - y_i) + \exp(y_i - w^Tx_i)\right)$$? I tried to google "log-sum-exp approximation" and the top few results are all using$$\log \sum_{i=1}^n \exp(x_i)$$.@@@It's the log-sum-exp approximation of the max function, it's correct :) I would suggest taking the partial derivative of $$f(w)$$ with respect to $$w_1$$. You will need to use the chain rule. Look at what the result looks like and see if you can figure out what the other partial derivatives look like. Once you have this, then you can try to gradually convert this to matrix/vector notation. If you implemented this gradient naively, you would have 2 for loops in your code. Try to eliminate the loops one by one, replacing them with a matrix/vector multiplication / norm, etc.@@@2017-05-30T07:36:38Z@@@hw2 student
