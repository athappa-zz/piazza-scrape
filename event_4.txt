Depth convention@@@I've noticed that in this course, a complete binary tree with 7 nodes would be considered one with depth 3 (was looking at a1, question 2.5). In past courses, it was taught that this would be depth 2. Are we to use the convention that counts nodes (as it seems) from root to bottom, or edges (as I was taught previously). I ask because I answered the question in a0 using the edges convention. =( EDIT: nevermind, I misunderstood.@@@I thinkboth conventions are sane. I don't think it's a big deal either way, as long as we're clear and consistent.@@@2017-05-21T02:16:33Z@@@hw0 student
A1: Q2.3@@@Does the simple_decision.py need to be compilable? Or does it just need to be python psudo code? And since it is specific to the dataset 'citiesSmall', can we assume that we know what the split decision threshold value?@@@1. It should be actual code. 2. Yes, use the specific splits learned by the decision tree on this data set.@@@2017-05-21T22:27:15Z@@@hw1 student
A1: Q4.2.2@@@Report the training and testing errors for condensed NN, as well as the number of variables in the subset, on the citiesBig1 dataset with k=1 What does the subset refer to in this question?

Python Syntax@@@I tried searching online, but I don't get what this piece of code does: y[X[:,d] == value]. As far as I can tell, X[:,d]==value converts a Nx1 array into True/False values. y is also Nx1, with values 1 or 2. What happens when you combine the two together? Does it spit back an array whose values come from y only if the row of X[:,d]==value is true? I tried that in the Python intepreter, and it didn't seem to do that.@@@Yes, that'scorrect. It's sometimes called boolean indexing. Not sure why it didn't seem that way when you tried it.@@@2017-05-21T04:05:16Z@@@other student
Question 1.1@@@EDIT: If one wishes to use the data and column names, one can do as suggested in the following post: @41 I'm getting an error when I try to run "main -q 1.1". It says that the random forest module doesn't exist. So I commented it out. But then I get another error when I try to print out the elements of the variable "names". It says that variable doesn't exist either. Do we have to define these ourselves?@@@EDIT: Hm, I stand corrected... not sure.@@@2017-05-20T22:34:58Z@@@hw1 student
A1: Q2.2 clarification@@@I know how to find the mode for continuous data, but I'm not entirely sure if we are supposed to write our own implementation of finding the mode for continuous data or if we are expected to use a method from Numpy.@@@The features are continuous, but the outputs are still discrete (categorical labels). When you find the mode it's for the labels, not the features.@@@2017-05-23T00:54:16Z@@@hw1 student
1.1@@@I'm having a difficult time understanding how to go about calculating the various summary statistics. I've tried using the numpy library but have noticed that those methods require arrays as input, and the load_dataset method provided returns a dictionary. I've tried to follow the mold of the other questions, but it doesn't seem to work... any guidance would be very nice. I've spent too much time on the first question already...@@@You can Index into the first item of the dictionary which is an array of the data you need to use the numpy operations on, if I am not mistaken.@@@2017-05-21T00:33:35Z@@@hw1 student
1.1@@@"Your main.py loads this data for you and stores it in the 2-D numpy array X , where each row corresponds to a week and each column corresponds to a different region. The names of the columns are loaded into the variable names ." It sounds like this is already done for us. But I can't seem to find X in main.py and I can't find "names" either@@@That is done in utils.py so we have to call that function in main.py@@@2017-05-21T01:44:19Z@@@hw1 student
Problem loading citiesBig1@@@I used "dataset = utils.load_dataset("citiesBig1")", and it showed something like this : I tried the alternative set as well but still doesn't work@@@Hmm.. it looks like you're using Python 2.7.

A1: Q2 - Unpickling error?@@@When I run python main.py -q 2 I get the following error: _pickle.UnpicklingError: the STRING opcode argument must be quoted From the following line of code (line 125) in utils.py: data = pickle.load(f, encoding='latin1') I'm usingPython 3.6.0 with Anaconda 4.3.1 (64-bit) on Windows 8.1. Anyone else having a similar issue? I've looked around online and the closest thing to a definitive answer I could get was that the pickled file may not be compatible with different versions of Python- has anyone gotten it to work for Python 3.6?@@@Did you forgot to add quotations around any of the .pkl files when you called utils.load_dataset("someDataSet")?@@@2017-05-21T02:43:04Z@@@hw1 student

Greedy Recursive splitting and training error@@@If we use the greedy recursive splitting algorithm to fit a decision tree and we allow depth to be arbitrarily large, do we always end up with a tree that will give us 0% training error?@@@Spend some time looking at question 2.4 on assignment 1.

A1: Q1.1 clarification@@@Does the question ask to compute statistics for each region separately or just once for the whole dataset?

How to pass by reference in python?@@@I want to have a function that can alter a variable in the caller, but I can't find a way to do so. Something like this: def outer_fun():     outer_var = 2     def inner_fun(outer_var):         outer_var=3         return     inner_fun(outer_var)     return outer_var print(outer_fun()) This print 2 because it is passed by assignment, but I want it to return 3. Please help.@@@It would probably be better to use classes and separate the two (and set outer_var as a field), but you can also fix this by using the nonlocal keyword and removing outer_var from the argument to inner_fun(). def outer_fun():     outer_var = 2     def inner_fun():         nonlocal outer_var         outer_var = 3         return     inner_fun()     return outer_var print(outer_fun())@@@2017-05-22T07:14:41Z@@@other student

Executing main on Spyder@@@I'm new to Python and I'm using an IDE called Spyder. I'm trying to understand how I would run something like "python main.py -q 1.1" on the IPython console? I know how to do it through my Terminal but is there a way to do it using Spyder? Thanks :)@@@I use Spyder as well. To enter arguments for command line, go to Run -> Configure, check the box for command line options, then enter "-q 1.1" in the box to the right. To run the other questions, just edit the box.  Or, you can directly type "runfile('../main.py', args='-q 1.1')" into the python console within Spyder. Make sure you enter the correct file path.@@@2017-05-20T22:52:46Z@@@hw1 student
citiesBig1 and citiesBig2@@@I printed the values of y for citiesBig1 and citiesBig2 and it seems like they are 0 and 1 for citiesBig1 and all 1s for citiesBig2. Is it supposed to be this way? I thought the y values were supposed to be either 1 or 2.@@@Yep. The actual values of the labels shouldn't matter, but you can have the y values be 1 and 2 if you want by just adding 1 to the array.@@@2017-05-22T07:26:59Z@@@hw1 student
Importing utils (name conflict)@@@I have the built-in Python module "utils" installed on my computer, so when I run "import utils", it imports the built-in module and not the one that we're supposed to use for the assignment.   Does anyone know how to direct Python into importing the correct module? Thanks in advance.@@@Not sure but seems like something you could Google around for. Or, something that would definitely work is renaming your utils.py to something else and making the corresponding changes tothe import statements in the code.@@@2017-05-20T23:06:07Z@@@hw1 student
