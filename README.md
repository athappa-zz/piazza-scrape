# Scrape Piazza Posts
* Scrape content from previous courses' Piazza posts
* To Do
    * Add my own classifier and compare MSPE to the authors'
    * Not even sure how they are clustering so probably want to figure that out
    * Events are messed up and they aren't being tagged properly
    * Working Dir is a nightmare: output data to another folder
