A4 Q5: Animal Data and Determining Good Graphs@@@Having trouble figuring out which method worked best. For example should bat be near gorillia or grizzly bear. Any chance are the features being used in the data known so that we can use that to determine the best fit? Also for Q5.2 what job are they trying to be best at?@@@I think even if we knew what features were included in the data set, it wouldn't necessarily help us (or hurt us) in teasing out what the latent factors might be. I don't think there's a method that works "best". Each method brings out different flavours in the data.@@@2017-06-16T18:31:49Z@@@hw4 student
A4 README@@@Looks like README hyperlinks on github stopped working. Can this be fixed?@@@If you are talking about this type of hyperlinks "./figs/highway_000.png" then it works fine for me. Try to refresh it or check your punctuation.@@@2017-06-17T03:49:43Z@@@hw4 student
A4 Q5@@@I was experimenting with different number of neighbours and found out that for NN=1 the plot is much more representative than for the other ones (I would say NN=1 is the best and NN=2 is the second best). But sincewe are asked to report NN=2 and NN=3 I want to clarify if I it is actually the case that NN=1 produces good representation and we are not asked to report it or I messed something up and my NN=1 and NN=2 are actually NN=2 and NN=3.@@@It's either you or me that's doing something wrong. You might be off by one? My 2 nearest neighbour looks pretty bad, while my 3 looks much better.@@@2017-06-16T05:04:22Z@@@hw4 student
A5: Q3 (4)@@@The model (4) says its Average of per-user and per-movie averages In the given code is the following (which the 'Per-movie' part is the same for part (3)). print("Per-movie average train loss: %f" % score(Y_pred_4, Y)) print("Per-movie average valid loss: %f" % score(Y_pred_4, Y_validate)) Should the print be the following instead? print("Per-user per-movie average train loss: %f" % score(Y_pred_4, Y)) print("Per-user per-movie average valid loss: %f" % score(Y_pred_4, Y_validate))@@@Yes@@@2017-06-18T00:53:47Z@@@hw5 student
Which Nearest Neighbour For A4 Q5.1@@@My scatterplots are different between choosing the decision rule for creating an edge between points that are mutually KNN or are one-wayKNN. Which implementation should I use? Should I look at how are they categorized to decide?@@@@255@@@2017-06-16T00:12:14Z@@@hw4 student
Determine the norm for latent factors@@@For PCA, I was wondering how do we determine the F in the equation?@@@The F denotes thefrobenius norm.@@@2017-06-16T23:02:57Z@@@other student
