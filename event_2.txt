Assignment format@@@Can we write down our answer on a piece of paper and scan it as a pdf file?@@@(some asked this same question last term, I'm pasting my answer below) You may submit your assignment as a scanned document but(1) I really, really don't recommend it and (2) you are at risk oflosing marks bydoing so. Every assignment will have some marks set aside for "mechanics" whichallows the TA to deduct marks if you did not make things easy for them. This would usually happen if a student did not read and follow the general homework instructions, or maybe made their plots super small so that they were hard to see, or didn't render their equations properly, etc. In the case of a scanned document, I will leave it to the TAs to decide how inconvenienced they are depending on how readable the scanned document is, but I give them permission to give zero for"mechanics" if they want. The current plan is for "mechanics"to be worthabout 10% eachassignment's grade. Rationale: first and foremost, I think producing digital documents is an essential skill these days. So, I was really tempted to say "no" to your request, for your own benefit! But on the other hand it's my job to teach you machine learning and I don't want to intrude too much by imposing all myworkflows for typesetting and publishing documents (I already appreciate that everyone is playing along with GitHub). Second, part of my job is to protect my the valuable time of my TAs so they can focus on helping you and your classmates learn. So if scanned documents are hard for them to read and this takes time away from other activities, I want to give them the power to discourage scanned submissions by deducting marks.@@@2017-05-17T18:52:36Z@@@hw0 student
Q 3.3@@@If the input x to a function is of type (for example) float , is it okay if we return (for example) an arrayof type int ? Thanks@@@I'm tempted to say that your gradients won't be accurate if you just spit out anint after you compute the gradients. You should test your gradientswiththe nice gradient approximation function we provide. Make sure you get similar answers. @Mike Gelbart anything to add?@@@2017-05-19T05:11:27Z@@@hw0 student
Iterate over indices@@@If we have an array and we want to iterate over the indices of the items in the array, is there a good way to do that? Do I just find the length of the array and do some form of for-loop? Thanks@@@Talking about something like this? https://docs.python.org/2.3/whatsnew/section-enumerate.html How to use: for i, item in enumerate(L):     # ... compute some result based on item ...

a0 - 4.2 Running times of code@@@Hi, I'm just wondering if we need to explain how we got the Big-O. Does it suffice to state just the Big-O without explanation? Thank you! Edit: Wrote down the reasons for good measure. Edit 2: Thanks for the input. I guess I'm just being paranoid haha.@@@The question just says to state it, so I don't think we need any explanation. Just my take.@@@2017-05-20T01:59:13Z@@@hw0 student

3.1 Q2@@@For 3.1 Q2, I was wondering if we are expected to get a number value or an equation? 2.Let  f(x)=sin(kx)f(x)=sin(kx) . What is the maximum value of the 20th derivative of  f(x) ?@@@Everything you need can be derived from the original expression. We're looking for another expression in terms available inthe original one.@@@2017-05-19T05:34:37Z@@@hw0 student
Learning with Non-Numerical Data?@@@Hello! So far in class we've covered how to predict labels based on continuous features such as location and quantity, but I'm now curious about how we would predict labels from non-continuous data, such as a chatbot that is trained on the textbook (the training data) and gives the correct chapter that I should brush up on (the label) when I ask it a question (the test data). The Markov chain is a nice technique, but the bag of words approach that it takes ignores the grammatical aspects of language, and therefore sometimes spouts nonsense words. Is there a way to somehow represent grammar rules (non-continuous data like that) in a numerical manner, or is there a completely different approach in training on non-continuous data? Thanks for your help!@@@This is quite a big question! There are lots of different ways of handing non-numerical data. It seems like you're interested in text in particular, which has its own specific approaches that aren't necessarily the same as other non-numerical data types. This field is calledNatural Language Processing (NLP), in case you want a starting point for searches. There are definitely methods that do *not* ignore the order of words (unlike bag of words). Something gaining popularity these days are recurrent neural networks (RNNs). For a fun blog post, seehttp://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/@@@2017-05-19T23:36:23Z@@@other student
Tutorial Material@@@I happen to be one of those unfortunate folks in 322 who has no tutorial section that fits my schedule. While I know we can attend other sections that are full, I was wondering if the material for tutorials will be posted elsewhere so that I could review it on my own time?@@@Yep, we'll post them at https://github.ubc.ca/cpsc340-2017S/home in a new directory for tutorial materials. It'll be the responsibility of the TA leading the tutorial to do this, so feel free to bug them if they haven't done it yet. BTW if you can only attend the third tutorial because of 322 then it's fine with me if you go even if it's officially full. Just don't take a set and leave a registered student standing. But this seems unlikely because we're moving them to bigger rooms and there should be enough seats.@@@2017-05-16T22:12:35Z@@@other student
[A0] How detailed do we need to be@@@Just wondering for A0 (and later assignments too if applicable), how detailed should our answers be? For example, do we need to include the formulas, stats model, intermediate steps, or just go for the final answer like P(X=1) = 1/2 ?@@@Whoops, nevermind, there's "you do not need to show your work" on assignment pdf.@@@2017-05-17T02:14:09Z@@@hw0 student
Using Jupyter for Report@@@Under the report format section of the homework instructions : "If you wish, you may embed your answers directly in the assignment document, as long as your submission is clear and easy to read." So, if we use a Jupyter notebook and put everything in there, do we still need to put separatecopies of the figures and code into the /figs/ and /code/ directory? Just wanted to double check for future assignments, thank you for your time!@@@No, if you use Jupyteryou can embed everything in there. If the figures are generated by the code in the notebook, which they presumably would be, then you wouldn't need the figure files to be saved separately.@@@2017-05-16T22:52:48Z@@@hw1 hw10 hw2 hw3 hw4 hw5 hw6 hw7 hw8 hw9 student

A0: 3.3 - Approximation & sig figs@@@For my output for bar_grad, I get the same results as the SciPy gradient method, but with extra decimal places. Should I trim these to match the SciPy output or is it okayto leave the extra decimals? Thanks in advance!@@@It sounds fine.

A0: 3.3 - Derivatives of Code@@@I have looked through the source code and know that I need to write a function that computes the gradient of a givenfunction. I know how to calculate gradients but I'm confused about what this foo_grad and bar_grad . Why do we need two functions to calculate the gradient? If someone can provide some guidance I'd really appreciate it.@@@Hopefully I understood your question correctly and my understanding of the question is correct. I believe that foo_grad is supposed to produce the gradient of the function that foo produces and bar_grad is supposed to produce the gradient of the function bar .@@@2017-05-19T01:47:11Z@@@hw0 student

Python and Numpy@@@In Matlab, quite a few matrix operations were vectorized. Does this result in any speed gain? E.g. if you increment all elements of a 1xN matrix, it wouldn't go through a for-loop but would do all of them simultaneously.@@@@@@2017-05-18T01:06:25Z@@@hw1 student
Q 3.3@@@Hi, I am a bit confused on what the output of the gradient functions should be. For foo(x) and bar(x), the outputs are numbers but when tested with scipy's gradient calculator, it returns an array. So for foo_grad(x) and bar_grad(x) do we return a number, or a scipy array? Thanks@@@You have to remember the definition of a gradient from multivariable calculus!  Let's say we have the following function: f(x_1,x_2,x_3) thus f is a function such that it maps from R^3 to R^1. Then: - f returns a *number* based on the input (x_1,x_2,x_3), which is a point in R^3. - gradient of f returns a vector in R^3 (-> in this particular example. In general, it returns a vector in R^n that matches the dimension of domain.)  I like to think of it this way (which could be wrong, by the way): in single variable, we usually we talk about 'derivatives' of functions, which is essentially how much the function changes with respect to change in the input variable. But when we start talking multivariable, we have to ask ourselves, "change in function with respect to *which* variables?".  So when we talk about partial derivatives, it's with respect to *one* input variable, but when we talk about gradients, it's with respect to *all* variables - hence the necessity to output a vector in the same dimension as the domain.  To answer your question: Yes, foo and bar both return a number because it is a multivariable function that returns a number in R^1. Meanwhile, foo_grad and bar_grad return a vector (or an array, as you pointed out) because it gives the gradient.@@@2017-05-19T22:46:46Z@@@hw0 student
Submitting assignments@@@The homework instruction md file said to push to github.ubc.ca, so I was wondering if it was just the latest push to our repo that is graded.@@@From homework_instructions " Submission We anticipate that you will clone your homework repo and do your work from within there. When you push something back to github.ubc.ca then you have submitted the assignment.

L3 Slide 15@@@My question is about slide 15 of Lecture 3. What is the result of the decision stump learning pseudo-code in the case where the mode below and above the threshold are the same? Do we just ignore this decision stump rule?@@@If the 2 categories have the same mode (say $$y=1$$), then that means that $$y=1$$ is also the mode of the entire dataset. In such a case, you can just ignore these rules and predict $$y=1$$ with no splitting. Does that help?@@@2017-05-16T22:30:36Z@@@other student
LaTeX Editor Recommendation@@@The recommened Texmaker prompts errors on mac, whenever I try to press the "run". I try to download the 2 older versions, same thing happen. The 2 online editors recommended are good, but I'm trying to get one that works without uploading a file. There seems to be a lot of LaTex editors online to choose. Can you please revommend another LaTex editor ? Thanks!@@@ShareLatex is pretty good! There's also plenty of support for Latex on Stackoverflow and stuff, so you can probably just google if you get stuck. If you're working with a partner, then OverLeaf might be better for collarboration. You usually don't have to upload a file unless you're attaching a diagram with your explanation or something, and even then it's not terribly complicated :)@@@2017-05-18T23:36:22Z@@@hw0 student
