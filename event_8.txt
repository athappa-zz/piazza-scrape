A3 3.3 query@@@Hey there, I'm a bit stuck on this question, would someone be able to explain to me what we are trying to do with the selected_new set? I'm a bit confused by fhe notion of "refitting" with only the features in that set.@@@selected_new contains a subset of the features. The minimize function, which you are given, takes in a subset of the features (such as selected_new ) and fits the model using only those features (by subsetting the data matrix X ). So you're supposed to fit the model using minimize andcompute theloss to seehow well the model performs with that particular subset of features. Then you find the best subset of features, and you see if you want to stick with it or terminate (based on the L0 norm criterion).@@@2017-06-05T15:27:40Z@@@hw3 student
Feature combinations that are greater than the individual features?@@@Just a thought, since we learn how to weight each individual feature is there a way to account for 'combos' of features to be weighted appropriately? For example, food could be both healthy or tasty but if it's both then it's more popular than just the sum of either.@@@Yes, definitely. We'll talk about this soon, in the context of the polynomial basis when $$d>1$$.@@@2017-06-05T03:18:19Z@@@other student
A3 Q2.3 - Cost@@@When we are calculating the cost, should we be including what it takes to find the hyperparameters like the degree of the polynomial or the variance of Gaussian RBF? Thanks!@@@1. There is no polynomial involved. The linear model refers to the one with the original data. 2. Use a fixed variance for the Gaussian RBF.@@@2017-06-06T01:56:26Z@@@hw3 student
Will A5 and A6 both be due on June 23rd?@@@According to the scheduled both of those assignments are due on the Friday of that week, wondering if thats how it is or theres an error. Cheers@@@That was an error. a6 no longer exists. I just fixed it.@@@2017-06-04T21:55:11Z@@@hw5 hw6 other student
